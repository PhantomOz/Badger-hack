# Project Name: BADGER

## Overview

BADGER is an innovative no-code application built for the Encode x Polkadot 24Q1 Hackathon. It leverages the power of Polkadot blockchain technology to enable users to create both Fungible Tokens (FTs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) smart contract with ease.

## Features

- **Token Creation**: Users can create FTs and NFTs by interacting with a user-friendly interface.
- **Substrate Compatibility**: Fully compatible with any Substrate-based blockchain.
- **Template Utilization**: Built using the robust inkathon template to ensure reliability and efficiency.
- **PSP Standard**: Tokens follows the Polkadot Standard 22 and 34.

## Tools

- [**_Inkathon_**](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon)
- [**_PSP22_**](https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/PSP22)
- [**_PSP34_**](https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/PSP34)
- [**_Ink_**](https://use.ink/smart-contracts-polkadot/)

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Users sign up and log into the platform.
2. **Token Configuration**: Users select the type of token they wish to create and configure its properties.
3. **Deployment**: The tokens are deployed to the chosen Substrate blockchain.
4. **Management**: Users can manage their tokens within the platform.

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to get a development environment running.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhantomOz/badger.git
cd badger
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Future plans

As we move on from the hackathon we plan to add more functionalities like:

- The ability for users dynamically select what features their contract should involve e.g if they want their token burnable, ownable, mintable, e.t.c.
- The ability for users to create `staking` contract, `governance` contract and more.
- Badger Sdk for developers to create and build, deploy smart contract on polkadot using languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#.
